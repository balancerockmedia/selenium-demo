selenium-demo
=============

### To run the tests ###

* Install and run selenium standalone server version 2.43 (2.44 has a bug and will not work with phantomjs)
* Make sure that chromedriver and phantomjs are in your system path
* Start local webserver on port 8080 using http-server
* Type `mocha` to run the tests (assumes you have mocha install globally)
